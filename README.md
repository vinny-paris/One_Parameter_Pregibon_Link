# One_Parameter_Pregibon_Link
The files allow for a crude estimation of a glm with a one parameter pregibon link to be estimated with data from the Bliss Beetle Set. Both logisitc and complementary log log are special cases of link family. This is not really for personal consumption as much as just a good place for me to hold onto some useful code to cannabilize later
